# WhoNeedsThis, the worlds stupidist and most embarrassing GitHub repo in existance.
Freaking three liner* with no meaning and no use other to display "Who Needs This"

Created >5 seconds because batch is easy.

Pertty retarded if you ask me, as BATCH is the new BASIC

*Three liner in Executeable code, spaces are not not counted. I swear, one liners from Arnald Schwarzenegger was better than this!
