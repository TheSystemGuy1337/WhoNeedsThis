# WhoNeedsThis
Freaking three liner* with no purpse but to display "Who Needs This"

Pertty Stupid if you ask me, as BATCH is the new BASIC*

Also, the README is a lie*

*Three liner in Executeable code, spaces are not not counted

2 *The Readme is kind of a lie, the *'s make up for that

3 *By new BASIC i mean BATCH is easyer to get into and more avable that BASIC, making it the new BASIC.
